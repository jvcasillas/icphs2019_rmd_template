\begin{abstract}
This is the layout specification and template definition for the papers of 
ICPhS XIX (the 19th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, which will be 
held in Melbourne, Australia, August 5-9, 2019). This template is a revised 
version of the one used for Glasgow ICPhS XVIII in 2015, originally generated 
from the template for Speech Prosody 2006 in Dresden.

The abstract may consist of more than one paragraph but must be kept within a 
150 word limit. This abstract will be printed in the abstract booklet to be 
given out at the conference.
\end{abstract}

\keywords{There is space for up to five self-selected keywords (maximally two 
lines).}


\section{Introduction}

The following rules apply to all submitted papers:

\begin{itemize}
  \item they must be written in English
  \item they must not contain the name(s) of the author(s) (for anonymous 
  review)
  \item the maximum is four pages for Congress papers, plus up to one 
  additional page of references. Papers for Plenary lectures can be longer
  \item they must be submitted in PDF format (cf. Section 4)
  \item the paper submission will occur via a web interface
\end{itemize}

This paper template can be found on the conference website. If there are
special questions or wishes regarding paper preparation and submission
for ICPhS 2019, correspondence should be addressed to
\href{mailto:icphs2019@arinex.com.au}{\nolinkurl{icphs2019@arinex.com.au}}.
Information for full paper submission will be available on the web at
\url{http://www.icphs2019.org/}.

\section{Page layout and style}

The page layout should conform to the following rules. By far the
easiest way to meet these requirements is to use the supplied templates
and check details against this example file. If for some reason you
cannot use the template, please follow these rules as carefully as
possible, or contact the editors at
\href{mailto:icphs2019@arinex.com.au}{\nolinkurl{icphs2019@arinex.com.au}}
for further instructions.

\subsection{Basic layout features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The layout is appropriate for A4 format.
  \item Two columns are used except for the title part and possibly for large 
  figures that need a full page width.
  \item Left margin is 20 mm. Right margin will depend on the size of the 
  paper. Column width is 80 mm.
  \item Spacing between columns is 10 mm.
  \item Top margin 25 mm (except first page which has 30 mm to the title top). 
  Bottom margin will depend on the size of the paper.
  \item Text height (without headers and footers) is a maximum of 235 mm. 
  Headers and footers should be left empty.
  \item Check indentations and spacings by comparing with this example file.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Headings}

Section headings are centered in boldface with capitalized letters.
Sub-headings start at the left margin in the column with the first
letter capitalized and the rest of the heading in lower case.
Sub-sub-headings appear like sub-headings, except that they are in
italics and not boldface. See examples in this file. No more than 3
levels of headings should be used. Empty lines should be left above and
below each section heading.

\subsection{Text font}

Times or Times New Roman font is used for the main text. Recommended
font size is 11 points. Other font types may be used if needed for
special purposes. If using any non-Unicode fonts, these must be embedded
in the final PDF file.

The \LaTeX template can be used either with plain \LaTeX or \XeLaTeX.

\subsection{Figures}

All figures should be centered on the column (or page, if the figure
spans both columns). Figure captions should precede each figure and have
the format given in Fig. \ref{fig:vowels}.

Figures should preferably be line drawings. If they contain grey shades
or colours, it should be checked that they print well on a high-quality
noncolour laser printer.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \caption{The vowel chart used in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).}
  \label{fig:vowels}
  \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=6cm]{./includes/figures/ipa.eps}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

An example of a table is shown as Table \ref{tab:decibel}. Somewhat
different styles are allowed according to the type and purpose of the
table. Colour should not be used, but grey shading is allowed. There
should be a margin of 6 points (pt) above and below the table.

The caption text may be above or below the table, but this should be
consistent throughout the submission. Left and right indentation of the
caption should be 0.5 cm.

\begin{table}[!ht]
  \caption{This is an example of a table showing Decibel (dB) ratios.}
  \label{tab:decibel}
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  \rowcolor[gray]{.75}
  ratio    & Decibels \\
  \hline
  $1/1$    & $0$      \\
  $2/1$    & $6$      \\
  $3.16$   & $10$     \\
  $1/10$   & $-20$    \\
  $10/1$   & $20$     \\
  $100/1$  & $40$     \\
  $1000/1$ & $60$     \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be placed on separate lines and numbered. An example of
an equation is given below: \begin{equation}\label{eq:tzero}
  t_0 = \frac{1}{f_0}
\end{equation} \noindent Numbers of equations can be on the right or on
the left margin of the text column.

\subsection{Examples}

Examples from other languages can either be presented in the body text,
or, if referred to elsewhere or particularly long and complex, can be
put on a separate, numbered line, as should be done for equations.

\subsection{Phonetic fonts}

We recommend that you use Unicode IPA phonetic symbols. For information
about how to access Unicode fonts, see \cite{IPA-SIL} or
\cite{IPA-KEYBOARD}. If you do not use Unicode symbols, the font you use
must be embedded. Please remember to check this, e.g.~by inspecting the
``Document Properties --- Fonts'' in Acrobat Reader. Or you can use
\texttt{TIPA}: \textipa{/Sip/-/SIp/}

\subsection{Page numbering}

Page numbers will be added electronically to the document later.
\textit{Please do not add page numbers and please do not make any footers or 
headers!}

\subsection{References}

Please use just the reference number in square brackets. Formulations
with author names like ``\ldots~as Ladefoged \cite{Ladefoged:2003}
showed that \ldots'' are acceptable but not ``as shown in {[}Ladefoged,
3{]}'' or ``as shown in (Ladefoged {[}3{]})''.

References are to be numbered in alphabetical order. Please double-check
the final version of your paper with regard to the correct
correspondence of references to their numbers.

\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Links to URLs or email addresses should be formatted as normal text,
\textit{not} as hyperlinks and not blue or underlined etc. Usually
hyperlinks to web pages are listed in the references section. If
required, line breaks can be placed within URLs after slashes or dashes
(cf.~\cite{IPA-SIL, IPA-KEYBOARD}), but doublecheck that no hyphens are
inserted.

\subsection{Footnotes and endnotes}

If footnotes cannot be avoided they should appear as
endnotes.\footnote{This 
footnote appears here as an endnote and could be avoided in this case.}

\section{Multimedia files}

Multimedia data that are part of the paper are to be embedded in the
submitted PDF; they cannot be submitted as supplementary data. Any
images are to be included in the paper as Figures (see Section 2.3
above). It is the authors' responsibility to check image quality ahead
of submission. Audio examples are to be embedded within the PDF. To do
this, authors can generate the PDF, and then embed the audio files using
Adobe Acrobat Professional. Alternatively, they may use other software
that offers the same outcome, so that the audio is included in the PDF.
The presence of audio data should be identified in the text.

We encourage authors to illustrate video data using still photographs
from the video, and to include them as figures in the PDF. We cannot
accept embedded video files, but authors are welcome to refer readers to
a URL on the internet where these can be viewed.

\section{PDF details}

PDF files submitted must comply with the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item all special fonts and symbols must be embedded in the PDF file so 
  that correct rendering of the PDF does not depend on the fonts installed 
  on the viewer's computer
  \item there must be no password protection on the PDF file, i.e. PDF files 
  must not be protected by PDF security in any way, i.e. content extraction, 
  document assembly, high resolution printing etc. must not be forbidden
  \item PDF files should not contain any colours, hyperlinks, multimedia or 
  3D content, and no JavaScript or forms
  \item PDF files should be no larger than 5 Mb.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Anonymity}

In ICPhS 2019 submissions, an anonymous reviewing process will be used.
This means that for the first submission the name(s) of the author(s)
and their affiliation(s) \emph{must not} be mentioned. In addition,
please refrain from using acknowledgements. Please also try to make your
own previous research as anonymous as possible. As an example: do not
write ``In our previous study {[}7{]} we could show\ldots'' but ``As
shown in {[}7{]}\ldots''. Or refer to your own published or otherwise
widely known work, and to that of the other authors, in the ``Julius
Caesar style'', i.e.~in the third person (for example: his work, her
work, their work). Reference as ``anonymous'' only work that you or the
other authors have submitted for publication, but which has not yet been
published, e.g.~{[}8{]}.

Please make sure that no author details appear in the Document
Properties of the PDF file.
\emph{For the revised paper submission author details are of 
course needed}. Acknowledgements and references to one's own work are
possible as usual.

\section{Format of references}

Monographs such as \cite{Fant:1960} consist of author(s) last name(s),
initial of the first name(s), year of publication, the title in italics,
location of the publication, publisher. Please use the punctuation signs
for structuring as presented in \cite{Fant:1960}.

The names of multiple authors are separated only by commas and they are
always listed in the sequence last name, comma, initial(s) of the first
name(s) (cf.~the examples \cite{Beattie/etal:1982} and
\cite{Peterson/Barney:1952}). Ampersands ``\&'' and ``and'' are not
needed.

Contributions to volumes, e.g.~\cite{Stevens:1999}, follow the
convention that the title of the volume is in italics, but not the title
of the contribution. The book editors appear before the book title. The
page numbers are at the end.

Journal articles should be handled in the same way as contributions to
volumes except that the title of the journal is in italics and that the
editors are not listed. Longer names of well-known journals can be
abbreviated, e.g.~\cite{Peterson/Barney:1952}. Articles in conference
proceedings such as \cite{Ladefoged:2003} are referenced in the same way
as journal articles. The word \textit{proceedings} can be abbreviated
and the location should be mentioned after the name of the conference.
Here, abbreviations of well-known conferences are possible.

\section{R scripts}

You can use knitr code chunks like in any .Rmd document:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{2} \SpecialCharTok{+} \DecValTok{2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4
\end{verbatim}

This includes inline code: 2 + 2 = 4.

R scripts can be loaded as well:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{source}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"./includes/scripts/analysis.R"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Which means you have access to any objects assigned in the script, like
Figure \ref{fig:ex_plot}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{cars\_plot}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\caption{This is a figure caption.}\label{fig:ex_plot}


\begin{center}\includegraphics{master_files/figure-latex/ex_plot-1} \end{center}
